Consider the following fragment of C code: 
     for (i=0; i<=100; i++) {
           a[i] = b[i] + C ;
     }
Assume that a and b are arrays of words and the base 
address of a is in $a0 and the base address of b is 
in $a1. Register $t0 holds the variable i and register 
$s0 the constant C. Write the code for MIPS. How many 
instructions are executed during the running of your 
code? How many memory data references will be made 
during execution?
