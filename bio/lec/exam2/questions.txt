1. Which one of the 5 Eukaryote Clades is are Land Plants in?
	>>> Archaeplastida

2. What are the 4 Subclades in the Archaeplastida?

	  +--+-- a. Red Algae

	--+	
	  |     +-- b. Chlorophytes 
	  |     |
	  +--+--+		
	        |	  +-- c. Charophytes
	        |	  |
			+--+--+ 
	        	  |
	        	  +-- d. Embryophytes

	
3. What is the Synapomorphy for the Archaeplastida clade?
	>>> Chloroplasts w/ double membrane

4. How did the Archaeplastida clade acquire its chloroplast?
	>>> via 1o endosymbiosis

5. Do Red Algae have flagellated gametes?
	>>> No

6. Where does Red Algae store glucose as starch?
	>>> OUTSIDE the chloroplasts (in cytoplasm)

7. What type of Cholorphyll does Red Algae have?
	>>> Cholorphyll a & d AND accessory pigment phycoerythrin

8. What abilities does Cholorphyll a & d AND Phycoerythrin give to Red Algae?
	>>> Since it is red, it can absorb all the other light on the spectrum except red.
	>>> Thus, it improves photosynthesis at great depeths in the water (260m)

9. What type of subgroup is Green Algae (i.e. Mono-, Para-, or PolyPhyletic group)?
	>>> Paraphyletic

10. What 2 groups in the Archaeplasida clade consists of the Green Algae?
	a. Chlorophytes (monophyletic clade)
	b. Charophytes (actually also a paraphyletic group) ---> ** Group most closely related to plants **

11. Which three sub-clades consist of the Viridiplantae clade (hint: there are the inner groups)
	a. Chlorophytes
	b. Charophytes
	c. Embryophytes

12. What are the 3 Synapomorphies of the Viridiplantae clade?	 
	a. Similar DNA sequences
	b. Contain Chloro. a & b & accessory pigment BETA-CAROTENE
	c. Stores glucose as starch INSIDE chloroplasts

13. What are the 3 Synapomorphies of the Chlorophyta clade?
	a. Similar DNA sequence
	b. 2 flagella on cell or gamete
	c. cup-shaped chloroplast
